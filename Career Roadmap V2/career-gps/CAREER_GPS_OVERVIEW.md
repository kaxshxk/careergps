# 🗺️ Career GPS: The AI-Powered Dynamic Career Architect

Welcome to **Career GPS**, a premium, interactive web application that acts as a real-time, adaptive career compass. Unlike static PDFs or generic career advice, Career GPS uses advanced AI to create a fully customized, living roadmap that adjusts dynamically to your budget, learning pace, and milestone completions.

---

## 📌 Problem: The Flaw in Career Guidance
Standard career counseling and roadmap templates fail users in three critical ways:
1. **Generic & Non-Contextual:** They treat a self-funded university student, a busy working professional, and a zero-budget self-taught learner identically.
2. **Static & Rigid:** Once written or downloaded, they never update. If a user completes a milestone or pivots, the document remains dead.
3. **Overwhelming & Expensive:** Standard paths push premium bootcamps and high-cost certificates, locking out motivated learners with limited budgets.

---

## 🌟 Vision: The Adaptive Compass
**Career GPS** changes the paradigm from a static document to an **interactive ecosystem**:
> "To democratize elite, bespoke career strategy. We provide every aspiring professional with a customized, visually stunning, and financially aligned blueprint that breathes and evolves in real-time as they learn, build, and progress."

## 👥 Target Audience
Career GPS is built to serve three primary learner groups:

| Segment | Primary Needs | Key Pain Point | Career GPS Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **College Students** | Core academic alignment, internships, clear study tracks. | Lack of industry-practical project guidance. | Custom semester-by-semester courses & milestone trackers. |
| **Career Switchers** | Efficient bridging, transferable skills matching. | Fear of restarting from scratch; time constraints. | Dynamic "Alternate Paths" highlighting skill overlaps. |
| **Self-Taught Learners** | High-quality free study plans, industry credentials. | High cost of premium courses & bootcamps. | Financial toggles filtering for free resources only. |

## 🎨 UI/UX Flow & Dynamic Experience

### 1. Kickresume-Style Premium Onboarding
* **High-End Interactive Questionnaire:** Users walk through an onboarding wizard that feels alive. It captures their current education stage, field of study, custom goals, and strengths using smooth micro-animations.
* **Dynamic Time Commitments:** Collects weekly availability to tailor calendar recommendations.
* **Financial Tiering Selector:** A crucial toggle letting users instantly switch their roadmap resources across three levels:
  * **Free Only:** Prioritizes zero-cost textbooks, NPTEL modules, and free learning paths.
  * **Affordable:** Introduces budget-friendly certifications (Coursera, Udemy).
  * **Self-Funded:** Opens paid mentorship, specialized bootcamps, and high-impact premium certificates.

### 2. D3.js Interactive Decision Tree
* **Fluid Visualization:** Rather than reading a long text document, users explore their career path as a beautiful, organic network of nodes.
* **Responsive Interactions:** Users can drag to pan, scroll to zoom, and click individual nodes.
* **Tactile Spring Checkbox Popover:** Clicking any milestone opens a popover card. Tapping the checkmark plays a smooth, bounce-back spring animation (`spring-pop`) and updates the user's progress.
* **Auto-Expand Progression:** Completing a goal automatically triggers the tree layout to expand, revealing the immediate next milestone path in real-time.
* **Visual Status Sync:** Completed milestone nodes instantly transition to emerald green (`#16a34a`), signaling clear progress.

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

* **Frontend Client (Vite + React 19):** Bundles and launches the interface instantly (less than 3 seconds) with hot-reloading responsiveness.
* **Styling (Vanilla CSS + Premium Variables):** Hand-tailored CSS classes (e.g. `.custom-checkbox`, `.card-emerald-glow`, `.lock-glow-pulse`) provide fluid glassmorphism, animated gradients, and tactile spring checkoffs without heavy styling libraries.
* **Secure Backend Proxy (Express):** Houses the Google Gemini API connection. This protects the developer key from browser exposure, sanitizes user inputs, and validates LLM schemas.
* **AI Engine (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash):** Generates fully customized questions and synthesizes specialized study/project blueprints dynamically.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

1. **Secure Onboarding Delivery:** Onboarding selections are packaged and sent to `/api/generate-roadmap`. The Express backend prompts Gemini to synthesize structural goals, alternative tracks, certifications, and skill gaps in a strict JSON format.
2. **Bulletproof Decision Trees:** To guarantee structural integrity (avoiding classic LLM tree nesting errors), the backend parses the AI milestones and **programmatically compiles** the D3.js Decision Tree nodes.
3. **Phase 2 Linear Grafting:** When the user completes their Phase 2 questionnaire, the system takes their customized 6-week study schedule and programmatically grafts a new linear chain (`"⚡ Deep Optimization"` -> `"Week 1"` -> ... -> `"Week 6"`) directly under the tree's root node.
4. **Bi-Directional State Sync:** Completion states are stored in browser `localStorage`. Clicking a card in the dashboard or checking a node in the D3 popover updates the same underlying state. This instantly recalculates the dynamic progress percentages.
