   - For **College Courses/Classes**: Suggest and prioritize **NPTEL** or **SWAYAM** for online credits and courses.
   - For **Internships & Jobs search**: Suggest and prioritize **Internshala** or **Naukri** as platforms.
   - For **Certifications**: Suggest and prioritize **NASSCOM**, **FutureSkills Prime**, or **SWAYAM** certifications rather than expensive Western platforms.
3. **Current Skill Adaptation**: Analyze the user's "Current Skills". If they already possess foundational skills, DO NOT repeat them in the first milestones; instead, start their roadmap at an appropriately advanced level.

### JSON Structure Requirements:

1. **goalsToAchieve**: A unified, chronological career and academic progression path.
${goalsToAchieveInstructions}

2. **collegeCourses**: An array of 3 recommended college courses or classes to take.
   - Each course object has:
     - **id**: string (e.g. "course-1", "course-2", "course-3")
     - **name**: string (name of course)
     - **semester**: string (e.g. "Next available semester" or "Within 2 semesters")
     - **reason**: string (why this is relevant based on their profile)
     - **financialTiers**: array of strings, containing at least one of ["LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH"] (who this is suitable for financially)

3. **internships**: An array of 3 recommended internship targets or roles.
   - Each internship object has:
     - **id**: string (e.g. "intern-1", "intern-2", "intern-3")
     - **role**: string (intern role title)
     - **when**: string (e.g. "Months 6-10" or "Year 2")
     - **platforms**: array of strings (where to look, e.g. ["LinkedIn", "Internshala", "Glassdoor"])
     - **stipendNote**: string (practical financial/compensation context)
     - **financialTiers**: array of strings, containing at least one of ["LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH"]

4. **certifications**: An array of 4 industry-recognized certifications.
   - Each certification object has:
     - **id**: string (e.g. "cert-1", "cert-2", "cert-3", "cert-4")
     - **name**: string (certification name)
     - **platform**: string (provider, e.g. "Coursera", "AWS", "Google")
     - **cost**: string (e.g. "Free", "$150", or "Paid subscription")
     - **duration**: string (e.g. "4-6 weeks")
     - **impact**: string (how it advances their resume/career)
     - **financialTiers**: array of strings, containing at least one of ["LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH"]

5. **alternatePaths**: An array of 3 alternative career paths if they pivot.
   - Each alternatePath object has:
     - **id**: string (e.g. "alt-1", "alt-2", "alt-3")
     - **title**: string (alternative career title, e.g. "Data Engineer")
     - **salaryRange**: string (estimated salary range)
     - **skillOverlap**: number (integer percentage between 0 and 100 representing overlap with current skills)
     - **pivotRequired**: string (what skills or qualifications they would need to add to pivot)

6. **skillGap**:
   - **have**: array of strings (skills they already possess, extracted and verified from their profile)
   - **need**: array of objects, mapping skills they lack to a milestone. Each object has:
     - **skill**: string (the skill they need to learn, e.g. "SQL" or "Cloud infrastructure")
     - **milestoneId**: string (must correspond to one of the goalsToAchieve milestones 'id' they will learn it at, e.g. "goal-1" or "goal-2")
   - **bridgingSteps**: array of 3 strings (actionable steps they can take starting today to bridge their skill gaps)

Crucial Rule: All JSON key names must match the exact casing specified above. Do not include a "decisionTree" key in your JSON, as the system will build it programmatically from your milestones. Ensure the milestones in skillGap.need list a milestoneId that matches one of the ids in goalsToAchieve.milestones.`;

1. A specific sub-specialization choice that fits their field (e.g. frontend vs backend, corporate accounting vs startup finance, etc.).
2. Their weekly time commitment (e.g. 5, 10, 15+ hours) or favorite learning style (video vs reading vs build-first).
3. The type of industry or employer they want to target (e.g. early-stage startup, corporate brand, research lab, global remote, freelance).

### STAGE-SPECIFIC FOCUS RULES:
Since this node represents a specific academic grade or college semester, you MUST focus the goals strictly on the typical milestones for this period. Do NOT repeat topics or skills across stages:
- **Grade 7-8**: Basic block coding, logic games, math puzzles, general curiosity. No advanced topics.
- **Grade 9**: Basic text programming (Python syntax), algebra/math foundations, active study habits.
- **Grade 10**: 10th board exams prep, stream/elective choice alignment.
- **Grade 11**: Specialization stream start, basic programming or commerce concepts in school.
- **Grade 12**: 12th board exams prep, college entrance preparation, college applications.
- **Semester 1**: College adaptation, GPA, campus coding/student clubs.
- **Semester 2**: Basic data structures, programming language basics, basic online problem solving.
- **Semester 3**: Relational databases (SQL), version control (Git & GitHub), small portfolio database-driven projects.
- **Semester 4**: Specialized portfolio project building, resume writing, summer internship search on Internshala.
- **Semester 5**: Advanced core subjects (OS, networks), final-year capstone project abstract preparation, remote internships.
- **Semester 6**: Placement preparation, LeetCode DSA practice (arrays, trees, graphs), mock interviews, major project prototype deployment.
- **Semester 7**: Job applications, campus placement drives, technical and HR interview rounds.
- **Semester 8**: Final capstone defense, clearing graduation credits, pre-onboarding modules.

### SPECIAL RULE FOR CHECKPOINT NODES:
This is a checkpoint node. Checkpoints represent milestones where the user pauses to review achievements and generate a mini-resume.
1. The "goals" array MUST be empty: [].
2. Return a list of 2-3 specific achievements/milestones suitable for this position/stage in the "achievements" array field (e.g. "Acquired Grade 10 Board Certification", "Completed stream selection and high-school academic path alignment").

## Age-Appropriate Content Rule (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
Stage: ${stage} — ${ageRule.rules}

## ZERO REPETITION RULE
Do NOT repeat any goal, skill, or milestone that appears in the already-completed list: [${completedGoalsList}]

Generate content specifically for THIS node ("${nodeLabel}") that directly helps ${profile.name} reach their goal of becoming a "${careerGoal}".
